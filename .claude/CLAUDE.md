## Project

Personal Finance app (Frontend Mentor challenge) built on a cross-platform design system
targeting React Native (Expo) and React web (React Router).

- **Package manager**: pnpm workspaces
- **Monorepo orchestration**: Turborepo (turbo.json — to be added in Phase 6)
- **Language**: TypeScript strict throughout
- **Org scope**: @financial-app/*

## Critical Workflow Rules
- **Shared responsibility** — you and the user share ownership of code quality and consistency. You are RESPONSIBLE. Care about every line you write — review your own output before presenting it.
- **Be concise** — no recap, no enumerations, no unsolicited explanations. Act, then report briefly if needed.
- **Discuss approach FIRST** — never code without confirming approach
- **Review → Test → Commit** per change — no accumulation
- **Never execute commands** — propose only. Exceptions: (1) user says "execute", "run", etc. (2) `pnpm type-check && pnpm lint && pnpm test` from root — MUST run after every code change, never skip
- **Risky actions** (git push, reset --hard, rm -rf) require explicit permission EVERY TIME
- **Never hallucinate** — if uncertain, read code first
- **Always use context7** for any question about an API, library, or package
- **Secrets** — live in `.env*` files — never in rules, memory, or code
- **Always use pnpm** — never npm or yarn, including for registry lookups (`pnpm view` not `npm view`)
- **Never `console.log`** — use `console.warn` / `console.error`
- **Never explicit `any`** — strict TypeScript
- **Always run** lint + typecheck + test + review once a set of modifications is done
- **Always ask** user to run pnpm dev, pnpm prod:server and pnpm storybook after having modified a component
- **Always create a Storybook story** after every component (`/story`)
- **Model**: Haiku for questions/research, Sonnet for code/commits — suggest Haiku when appropriate
- **For React**: instead of using `React.` for react types, import the type from react
- **Screenshot**: given screenshot names are always files located in desktop, otherwise the full file path is given

## Current State vs Target

### Exists now
```
apps/
  mobile/              bare RN CLI — learning reference, may be aligned from time to time
  mobile-expo/         Expo SDK 54 — CANONICAL mobile app, primary focus
  mobile-expo-ejected/ ejected Expo — learning reference, may be aligned from time to time
packages/
  ui/       @financial-app/ui — RN-only, needs cross-platform refactor
```

> **Production-grade**: all 3 mobile apps are kept intentionally to compare bare RN CLI
> vs Expo managed vs Expo ejected. All are held to production-grade quality.
> Only mobile-expo will be published. The other two may be updated to stay aligned.
> Never delete them.

### Target after all phases
```
apps/
  mobile/              renamed from packages/mobile-expo
  web/                 new — React Router + Vite
packages/
  tokens/              new — Style Dictionary, single token source of truth
  tailwind-config/     new — shared Tailwind config consumed by both apps
  ui/       refactored — cross-platform via file extension split
  shared/              new — Supabase, Jotai atoms, TanStack Query, types, utils
```

## Core Architecture Decisions

1. **Cross-platform components**: file extension split
   - `Component.tsx` — types + props interface only, no JSX
   - `Component.native.tsx` — React Native implementation (twrnc)
   - `Component.web.tsx` — DOM implementation (Tailwind CSS + cn())

2. **Styling**: twrnc on native, Tailwind CSS on web — NOT NativeWind (too unstable)

3. **Shared variants**: CVA (`class-variance-authority`) in `src/variants/` — platform-agnostic
   class strings consumed by both .native.tsx and .web.tsx

4. **Token pipeline**: Style Dictionary JSON → JS/TS + CSS vars + Tailwind map + RN values

5. **Layer order**: tokens → tailwind-config → ui → apps

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- NEVER hardcode colors/spacing in app configs — always from @financial-app/tokens
- NEVER import react-native in .web.tsx files
- NEVER import HTML elements or cn() in .native.tsx files
- NEVER commit packages/tokens/build/ — it is always generated
- NEVER put hover:/focus:/transition-/shadow- classes in shared CVA variants
- NEVER add renderer imports to packages/variants/, hooks/, or shared/

## Reference Files (load on demand — NOT auto-loaded)
| File                 | When to load                                                    |

| `troubleshooting.md` | Debug, architectural decisions                                  |

**Before coding**: ask which reference files are needed — do NOT start coding without the relevant files loaded.

## Session State

### Completed

Read `@completed.md`

### Next
- Phase 7, Step 7.2 CONTINUE: create route pages in mobile-expo app/ directory
- Focus on mobile-expo: overview page + auth, then come back to align apps/mobile

### Next (Track B — UI components, separate session)
- Wave 2 COMPLETE: 9 overview primitives (ColorDot, Avatar, Divider, SectionLink, BalanceCard, StatCard, TransactionRow, BillSummaryRow, SpendingSummaryRow)
- Wave 3 PARTIAL: 3 of 4 overview sections done (PotsOverview, TransactionsOverview, RecurringBillsOverview)
- Remaining: DonutChart + BudgetsOverview (deferred together)
- Review done on Wave 2+3: all critical + high findings fixed (4e32a4d)
- **Next step: create `@financial-app/icons` package** (see below), then DonutChart + BudgetsOverview, then review mockups to identify missing icons
- Wave 1 COMPLETE: Button refactored + TextInput, PasswordInput, LinkText, AuthCard, AuthLayout created
- Storybook is set up (`pnpm --filter @financial-app/ui storybook`)

#### Icons Package — `@financial-app/icons`

Create a dedicated `packages/icons/` package that converts raw SVG files into React components via a build script.

**Reference**: `vite-mf-monorepo/packages/shared/src/assets/` + `script/export-svgs.js` — proven SVG-to-JSX pipeline using `svg-to-jsx`. Adapted for cross-platform: web output uses standard `<svg>`, native output uses `react-native-svg` components.

**Workflow**:
1. Drop SVG source files into `packages/icons/src/assets/`
2. Run `pnpm --filter @financial-app/icons build` — the build script converts each SVG to a React component (TSX), generates a barrel `index.ts`, and compiles with `tsc`
3. Consumers import icons as named exports: `import { HomeIcon, PotIcon } from '@financial-app/icons'`

**After the package is scaffolded and building**, review the Figma mockups to identify which icons are needed and where they should be used across the app (nav tabs, section headers, action buttons, etc.).

### Known Issues
- Review SEC-006: `redirectTo` in oauth.ts not validated — open redirect risk. Defer until login UI is built.
- Review ARCH-003b: factories read env vars directly instead of accepting params — trades testability for DX. Revisit if unit testing becomes painful.
- Review SEC-002: bare RN uses plain AsyncStorage for tokens (unencrypted) — acceptable for learning reference, not published
- Google client IDs empty in .env files — need Google Cloud Console setup before testing OAuth

- Responsive phone/tablet layouts: need to research Expo Router adaptive layouts + useWindowDimensions patterns with context7 before building Overview components
- `expo-dev-client` not yet tested on mobile-expo-ejected
- mobile-expo-ejected `ios/` is gitignored — icon update is local only
