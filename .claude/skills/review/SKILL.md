# Review — Multi-Agent Code Reviewer

Orchestrates 5 parallel domain-expert subagents to review changed files against project rules.
Produces a structured JSON report with findings sorted by severity.

## Prerequisites

- `pnpm type-check && pnpm lint && pnpm test` must PASS before triggering review
- If any of those fail, fix them first — the reviewer assumes clean static analysis

## Execution Flow

### Step 1 — Scope Detection

Determine which files to review (priority order):
1. User-specified files/directories
2. Files changed on current branch vs main/master (`git diff --name-only main...HEAD`)
3. Staged files (`git diff --cached --name-only`)
4. Files in last commit (`git diff --name-only HEAD~1`)

Filter to only: `*.ts`, `*.tsx`, `*.js`, `*.jsx`, `*.json` (exclude `node_modules`, `build/`, `dist/`, lock files)

### Step 2 — Load Context

Read all files in scope. For each file, determine which reference guides apply:
- `.native.tsx` → platform-safety.md, accessibility.md
- `.web.tsx` → platform-safety.md, security.md, accessibility.md
- `*.variants.ts` → platform-safety.md (forbidden classes)
- `packages/ui/src/components/**` → architecture.md, quality.md
- `packages/tokens/**` → architecture.md
- `apps/**` → security.md, quality.md, accessibility.md
- All files → quality.md

### Step 3 — Dispatch 5 Parallel Subagents

Launch all 5 agents simultaneously using the Agent tool. Each agent receives:
- The list of files in scope (content already read)
- Its domain-specific reference guide
- The JSON schema for findings output
- Instruction to return ONLY a JSON array of findings (no prose)

Agents:
1. **Platform Safety** — reference: `references/platform-safety.md`
2. **Security** — reference: `references/security.md`
3. **Architecture** — reference: `references/architecture.md`
4. **Quality** — reference: `references/quality.md`
5. **Accessibility** — reference: `references/accessibility.md`

Each agent prompt must include:
```
You are a code reviewer specialized in [DOMAIN].
Review the following files against the rules in the reference guide.
Return ONLY a valid JSON array of findings. No prose, no markdown fences around the JSON.
If no violations found, return an empty array: []
Each finding must follow this exact schema: [paste from schema.json]
Use severity levels: critical, high, medium, low
Prefix IDs with: PLAT- / SEC- / ARCH- / QUAL- / A11Y-
If a finding depends on library version behavior or API correctness that you are not 100% certain about,
set "needs_verification": true and provide a "verification_query" string for context7 lookup.
Only use this for ambiguous cases — do NOT flag project-specific rule violations as needing verification.
```

### Step 4 — Aggregate & Score

Merge all findings into a single report. Calculate scores:

```
category_score = max(0, 100 - (critical * 25) - (high * 10) - (medium * 3) - (low * 1))
```

Weights for overall score:
- Platform Safety: 25%
- Security: 25%
- Architecture: 20%
- Quality: 15%
- Accessibility: 15%

Verdict thresholds:
- 80-100 + no critical/high remaining → `ready`
- 60-79 → `needs-attention`
- < 60 → `needs-work`

### Step 5 — Report to User

Present findings grouped by severity (critical first), then by category.
Format as a readable table, followed by the score summary and verdict.

### Step 6 — Verify Ambiguous Findings (context7)

Before fixing, check findings where `needs_verification: true`:
1. Run the `verification_query` through context7 to confirm the finding is valid
2. If context7 confirms the issue → proceed with fix
3. If context7 shows the usage is correct → discard the finding, adjust score
4. This prevents false positives from outdated assumptions about library APIs

Common verification scenarios:
- Deprecated API detection (is this prop/method still valid in current SDK version?)
- Prop signature changes (did accessibilityState shape change?)
- Library-specific patterns (is this Supabase usage safe in current version?)
- Expo/RN version-specific behavior

### Step 7 — Fix Loop (max 3 iterations)

If verdict is NOT `ready`:
1. Fix all `critical` findings immediately
2. Fix `high` findings
3. Re-run affected agents only (not all 5) on modified files
4. Repeat up to 3 times total

### Step 8 — Handle Remaining Violations

If violations remain after 3 iterations:
- Present remaining violations to the user
- Ask: **store** (write to `review-results/`) or **ignore** (proceed without storing)
- If stored, write to `review-results/YYYY-MM-DD_HHmmss.json`

## Output Format

The final JSON report follows the schema in `references/schema.json`.

## Integration

This skill is triggered by the main agent after every code session that produces changes,
immediately after `pnpm type-check && pnpm lint && pnpm test` passes.

The main agent MUST NOT skip this step. The review is mandatory for:
- New components
- Modified components
- New packages or significant refactors
- Any changes to shared code (variants, hooks, utils)

Optional (user decides) for:
- Config-only changes (tsconfig, package.json)
- Documentation-only changes
- Changelog updates
